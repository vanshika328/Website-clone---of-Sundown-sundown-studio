The Sundown website clone is a project aimed at replicating the aesthetics, functionality, and user experience of the original Sundown website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), and Locomotive Scroll library. The goal is to create a visually appealing and interactive website that mirrors the design and features of Sundown while utilizing modern web development technologies.
